I imagine theywere startled to find themselves in the sun.I imagine the tide simply went outwithout them. I imagine they cannotfeel the black flies charting the raised hillsof their eyes. I write my name in the sand:Donika Kelly. I watch eighteen seagullsskim the sandbar and lift low in the sky.I pick up a pebble that looks like a green egg.To the ditch lily I sayI am in love.To the Jeep parked haphazardly on the narrowstreetI am in love.

              "  'poem': 'All houses wherein men have lived and diedAre haunted houses. Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it wasme:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I—we—were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof theNational Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you’ll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are anI,you are anElizabeth,you are one ofthem.Whyshould you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance—I couldn’t look any higher—at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similarities—boots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventheNational Geographicand those awful hanging breasts—held us all togetheror made us all just one?How—I didn’t know anyword for it—how “unlikely”. . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn’t?The waiting room was brightand too hot.

Through the open doorsThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,With feet that make no sound upon the floors.We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,Along the passages they come and go,Impalpable impressions on the air,A sense of something moving to and fro.There are more guests at table than the hostsInvited; the illuminated hallIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,As silent as the pictures on the wall.The stranger at my fireside cannot seeThe forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;He but perceives what is; while unto meAll that has been is visible and clear.We have no title-deeds to house or lands;Owners and occupants of earlier datesFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,And hold in mortmain still their old estates.The spirit-world around this world of senseFloats like an atmosphere, and everywhereWafts through these earthly mists and vapoursdenseA vital breath of more ethereal air.Our little lives are kept in equipoiseBy opposite attractions and desires;The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,And the more noble instinct that aspires.These perturbations, this perpetual jarOf earthly wants and aspirations high,Come from the influence of an unseen starAn undiscovered planet in our sky.And as the moon from some dark gate of cloudThrows o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowdInto the realm of mystery and night,—So from the world of spirits there descendsA bridge of light, connecting it with this,O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.'},\n",

that night amang the shaws,She got a fearfu\\' settlin\\'!She through the whins, and by the cairn,And owre the hill gaed scrievin,Whare three lairds\\' lands met at a burnTo dip her left sark-sleeve in,Was bent that night.Whyles owre a linn the burnie plays,As through the glen it wimpl\\'t;Whyles round a rocky scaur it strays;Whyles in a wiel it dimpl\\'t;Whyles glitter\\'d to the nightly rays,Wi\\' bickering, dancing dazzle;Whyles cookit underneath the braes,Below the spreading hazel,Unseen that night.Among the brackens, on the brae,Between her and the moon,The deil, or else an outler quey,Gat up and gae a croon:Poor Leezie\\'s heart maist lap the hool!Near lav\\'rock-height she jumpit;but mist a fit, and in the poolOut-owre the lugs she plumpit,Wi\\' a plunge that night.In order, on the clean hearth-stane,The luggies three are ranged,And every time great care is ta\\'en\\',To see them duly changed:Auld Uncle John, wha wedlock joysSin\\' Mar\\'s year did desire,Because he gat the toom dish thrice,He heaved them on the fireIn wrath that night.Wi\\' merry sangs, and friendly cracks,I wat they didna weary;And unco tales, and funny jokes,Their sports were cheap and cheery;Till butter\\'d so\\'ns, wi\\' fragrant lunt,Set a\\' their gabs a-steerin\\';Syne, wi\\' a social glass o\\' strunt,They parted aff careerin\\'Fu\\' blythe that night.'},\n",
